- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

The vulnerability is that the insecure version does not sufficiently log errors or caught exceptions. This means
that when something goes wrong, there are insufficient measures to catch attackers, prevent the issue, and detect
security faults. It also means that security breaches can go undetected if users can make DB changes without any footprints.
By logging errors and any calls to the endpoint, there is a footprint created to track all
authorized and unauthorized request calls (ie - db changes), making it easier to catch abnormal activity.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Beyond logging, we should have scripts or some process of auditing and reading logs to detect abnormalities/suspicious patterns.
We can also protect db access/other systems to ensure that they are immutable.
