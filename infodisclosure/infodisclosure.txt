Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The user input is not sanitized, allowing MongoDB queries themselves to be inserted into the 
code. Passwords on users could be received with the query "username[$ne]=". The secure
version prevents this by sanitizing input into strings and replacing non alphanumeric characters.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?

This affects confidentiality and availability, where confidential information could be revealed to users
and made available ot unauthorized individuals simply through an unsanitized textbox insertion.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Additional measures would include not returning the entire user information and hashing passwords so that
they are not made visible in plain text, even if exposed.
